# Musicmapp Package
  
Our package contains two functions.  The most useful is the run_shiny() function which runs our eventful map visualization shiny app.  This application can search for events in the US by date, category, and location. It has a maximum of 1000 events which will be returned.  The other function, search_events() makes a request to Eventful.com and returns a dataframe of events based on request inputs. This dataframe is used by the first function run_shiny().

You can install the package by running `devtools::install_github("jfr25/Group8_Project")`

The app can also be reached on the webpage
 `https://skizcoder.shinyapps.io/EventfulMap/`
